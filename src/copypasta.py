                "and I think that’s really unfair. I don't think that any major other than ECE, Engineering, " \

                "really get you a good job after college. Still many people (myself included) are rejected from " \

                "majors are the smartest anyway, so there really isn't a need to have majors for people who won't " \
                "bring up the university's rankings. All of the other programs that aren't as good (worse, useless, " \
                "unnecessary) should be removed because they aren't as good and can only bring down the school's " \
                "competitiveness, making those in the Engineering and ECE majors take the hit for other major’s " \
                "incompetence. Yes, other programs might also be ranked highly, but in the end it doesn’t matter " \
                "because those majors simply aren’t important, and recruiters agree with me. Overall, " \
                "each university’s ranking is super important because recruiters obviously see the difference " \
