sat_copypasta = "Personally, I think that instead of removing the SAT scores for public universities, they should be " \

                "smartest students may lose a seat to someone dumber than them just because they live in the state, " \
                "and I think that’s really unfair. I don't think that any major other than ECE, Engineering, " \
                "or maybe CS is worth people's time at a university, because those are the only degrees that will " \
                "really get you a good job after college. Still many people (myself included) are rejected from " \
                "programs like these because of stupid people who get in with lower SAT scores with us, " \

                "completed 20 APs before going to college, you’re bringing the entire university down. \n" \
                "Aside from increasing the difficulties of SAT exams, universities should narrow down the majors " \

                "majors shouldn’t be taking up my spot in the university just because they want to study a useless " \

                "people care about majors that won't gain them the maximum time:money ratio. ECE and Engineering " \
                "majors are the smartest anyway, so there really isn't a need to have majors for people who won't " \
                "bring up the university's rankings. All of the other programs that aren't as good (worse, useless, " \
                "unnecessary) should be removed because they aren't as good and can only bring down the school's " \
                "competitiveness, making those in the Engineering and ECE majors take the hit for other major’s " \
                "incompetence. Yes, other programs might also be ranked highly, but in the end it doesn’t matter " \
                "because those majors simply aren’t important, and recruiters agree with me. Overall, " \
                "each university’s ranking is super important because recruiters obviously see the difference " \
                "between T5 and T3 schools, even if they publically express otherwise. Lets be honest, these are the " \
                "jobs that need to have the smartest people because they are the ones who do everything for all " \
                "other fields who can't do it for themselves (we have to help them make things) so we're really " \
                "important. Anyway, my point here is that UIUC should remove all programs except ECE, Engineering, " \
